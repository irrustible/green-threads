# green-threads

Stackful coroutines for stable rust.

## Status: pre-alpha, do not use

This library is essentially a hand-written pile of various assembly
dialects written from first principles and the help of the
internet. It has not been tested on any architecture at all at this
point and you should assume it doesn't work.

Are you an ABI expert? Please review my code. God knows it could use more eyes.

## Usage

```rust
fn main() {




}
```

## Support

If your architecture does not appear in the list below, we haven't even attempted to support it:

* aarch64
* arm
* x86
* x86_64
